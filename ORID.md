Objective
Today, we focused on learning React Hooks—useContext and useReducer—to understand their usage and application. In the afternoon, we practiced these concepts and participated in a design pattern speech competition. Our group presented on the strategy pattern, while others covered iterator, observer, and state patterns. We achieved second place. Finally, we held a retro meeting to review weekly challenges and discuss improvement strategies.

Reflective
Learning useContext and useReducer was challenging but rewarding. Despite initial complexity, completing the exercises brought a sense of achievement. The group speech competition showcased teamwork and preparation, leaving us satisfied with our collaborative effort. The retro meeting reinforced a sense of cohesion and growth within the team.

Interpretive
The morning’s learning revealed how Hooks can streamline state management and improve component logic. The competition deepened our understanding of strategy patterns and expanded our knowledge through others’ presentations, like observer patterns. Achieving second place affirmed our efforts and motivated us to improve further.

Decision

Practice React Hooks in projects to solidify understanding.
Enhance teamwork by learning from other groups’ strengths in presentations.
Address retro issues by identifying solutions and implementing them collectively.
