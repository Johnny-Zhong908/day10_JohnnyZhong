ORID
Objective:
I have recently learned React Router, Axios, Promise, and basic usage of some UI libraries. Understood their specific applications in the project.
Reflection:
I feel that learning these contents is somewhat difficult, especially the asynchronous processing of promises, which is a bit convoluted. However, I also deeply feel the magic of front-end development, which can enable complex functions to be implemented so flexibly.
Interpretive:
By learning these tools, I realize that they are an important component of modern front-end development. React Router is responsible for routing management, Axios handles data requests, Promise solves asynchronous problems, and the UI library greatly improves development efficiency.
Decision making:
Next, we need to practice more practical project scenarios to deepen our understanding of asynchronous logic and component-based development, while exploring more complex UI library functionalities.
